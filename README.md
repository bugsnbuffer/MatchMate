# MatchMate 🚀

MatchMate is a web application built using the MERN stack that helps users find like-minded individuals nearby with similar interests. The concept is simple: users can discover potential mates with whom they share common hobbies, and if there's mutual interest, they can connect and plan activities together.

## 🌟 Features

- **Interest Matching:** MatchMate uses advanced algorithms to match users based on their shared interests, making it easy for people to connect with others who enjoy similar activities.

- **Hangout Suggestions:** Once matched, users can explore suggested profiles and find potential mates for various activities such as going to the gym 💪, attending events or concerts 🎤, grabbing coffee ☕, watching a movie 🎬, and more.

- **User Profiles:** Each user has a detailed profile highlighting their interests, making it easier for others to understand their preferences.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

MatchMate is developed using the MERN stack, which includes:

- **MongoDB:** Database for storing user data and preferences.
- **Express:** Server framework for building the backend.
- **React:** Frontend library for building user interface.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
